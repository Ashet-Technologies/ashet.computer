## Project Status & Roadmap

### []($image.siteAsset('img/check.svg')) Design
  
The Ashet Home Computer has completed its design phase, and a practical, achievable hardware concept is now finalized.

There are still many smaller design components to be refined, but the overall concept is done.

*Check out the [hardware design]($link.page('hardware')) to learn more about the system.*
  
### []($image.siteAsset('img/check.svg')) Prototyping
  
A functional *cable clutter prototype* has been created which validates all of the design ideas.

This includes:

- PSRAM Support
- DVI Video Generation
- Backplane Communication
- Expansion Card Drivers
- Ethernet
- I²C Subsystem

Currently, the RP2350 processor successfully boots the operating system and supports launching desktop applications.

The mechanical design is also validated by building a mock-up of the final hardware and case assembly.

*Check out the prototype images and videos in the [gallery]($link.page('gallery').ref('home-computer-photo'))!*

### []($image.siteAsset('img/wrench-clock.svg')) Engineering

The next stage after prototyping will be the actual engineering. This includes creating schematics, pcb layouts,
evaluation of hardware limits and EMI emissions.

In this phase, the fully production-ready computer will be built.

To fund development for this critical next stage, we will launch a crowdfunding campaign on a platform such as Indiegogo or Kickstarter.

*Subscribe to our [newsletter](https://buttondown.com/ashet.computer) to get notified when the fundraiser starts!*

### []($image.siteAsset('img/wrench-clock.svg')) Production &amp; Release

In parallel to the engineering, a manufacturing partner must be found that will produce and distribute the Ashet Home Computer.

No matter what's the outcome of this phase, the whole computer design will be available for free and can be built by everyone.
