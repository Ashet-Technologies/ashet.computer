SPU&nbsp;Mark&nbsp;II™ is a new generation of 16-bit CPUs tailored for low resource usage.

Contrary to most CPUs on the market, the SPU&nbsp;Mark&nbsp;II™ is a stack machine, providing benefits
to both hardware implementors and programmers. It's as easy to write or compile code for the SPU&nbsp;Mark&nbsp;II™
as it is to create a hardware realization of it.

Ashet&nbsp;Technologies™ is proud to provide you with this new technology and enables you to create new low power
systems with an easy.

## Features

- Highly orthogonal instruction set
- Optimal utilization of the encoding space
- True 16 bit architecture
- Comes with a good bunch of companion IP cores for better integration
