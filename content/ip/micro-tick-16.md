The MicroTick 16 is a versatile 16-bit timer component designed for precise timing and control applications. Equipped with a prescaler and the ability to generate interrupts (IRQs), the MicroTick 16 is ideal for embedded systems requiring accurate timing functionality.

## Key Features

- **16-bit Timer**: Provides precise timing with a 16-bit counter.
- **Prescaler**: Adjustable prescaler to fine-tune the timing intervals.
- **IRQ Generation**: Capable of generating interrupts for event-driven applications.

## Applications

- **Embedded Systems**: Ideal for applications requiring precise timing such as task scheduling, pulse generation, and event counting.
- **Industrial Automation**: Suitable for timing operations in automated control systems.
- **Consumer Electronics**: Perfect for use in devices that need accurate time-based functions.

## Configuration

- **Prescaler Settings**: Configurable to divide the input clock, providing a wide range of timing intervals.
- **IRQ Handling**: Integrated with the system’s interrupt controller to trigger and handle IRQs efficiently.
