<h1>About Us</h1>

<h2>Company History</h2>

<p>
  Ashet&nbsp;Technologies™ is an <em>art project</em> revolving around the <em>Ashet&nbsp;Home&nbsp;Computer™</em>. Its
  primary goal is
  to recreate the 80ies home computer experience, but in a more modern environment.
</p>

<p>
  Modern computers are impressive and useful machines, but also so complex that most people are overwhelmed. You have to
  learn about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory">virtual memory</a> even before you are able to even
  learn to handle regular memory. You have to learn about <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_call">syscalls</a> before ever using <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_I/O">MMIO</a>.
</p>

<p>In contrast to this, on a good ol' <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80">Z80</a> system, writing to a
  serial port was a single <code>OUT ($10), A</code> instruction that directly wrote to the serial port. Back in the
  time you were able to fully understand your machine. Not only you did know how to write a console app, but you were
  also able to use every component of the machine without drivers, as you had all the direct access, and the hardware
  interface was mostly simple.
</p>

<p>The Ashet&nbsp;Home&nbsp;Computer™ project tries to recreate that experience under the hood of the
  <em>Ashet&nbsp;Technologies™</em>
  fake company. That company is settled in a cyberpunk dystopian world similar to the one found in Shadowrun or
  Cyberpunk&nbsp;2077. The "products" and software by that company are all components of the bigger picture, together
  creating an environment where you can have the <em>Home Computer Experience</em> in modern times.
</p>

<p>The <em>Ashet&nbsp;Home&nbsp;Computer™</em> is designed to be simple enough to be grasped fully by a novice
  programmer or user and should enable people to learn about computers and programming. A secondary design goal is to
  create an actually usable computer, not only a toy. Definitly not competetive to modern PCs or single board computers,
  but still able to connect to the internet, create documents and pictures and play games.</p>

<p>The project draws inspiration from the late-80ies home computers like the <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_500">Amiga 500</a>, <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorn_Archimedes">Acorn Archimedes</a> and others, but also tries to create a
  more <a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Cyberpunk">cyberpunk</a> inpsired look and feel.</a>

<h2>Open Source</h2>

<p>The project is designed as an open source project, so people can easily join and contribute. All source code and
  hardware descriptions can be found at <a
    href="https://git.random-projects.net/Ashet-Technologies">git.random-projects.net</a>.</p>

<h2>Who are we?</h2>

<p>The project is mainly driven by <a href="https://random-projects.net/">Felix "xq" Queißner</a>, a retro and computer
  enthusiast from southern germany.
